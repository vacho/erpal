<h1>Working with documents</h1>
<h2>Create, manage and export documents</h2>
<p>
Documents are structured like books: they consist of pages and subpages. The overview will allow you to search through the documents. 
Clicking on "Templates" will lead you to the overview of all the templates youâ€™ve created. A template can be a single page or a whole document. You can add single pages of these templates into new documents or even clone a whole document.
Clicking on the title of a document will lead you to the document view. If the document has some subpages you will see a tree view of those pages in the right sidebar. You can drag and drop the pages there to reorder them or to change the structure of the document.
</p>
<p>
Hovering over the "Actions" button will give you some options for working with the document: 
<ul>
<li>Add a page: Adds a subpage to the current page</li>
<li>Export: Exports the whole document or a single page as an .odt-File for LibreOffice</li>
<li>Add pages cloned: Adds pages that you cloned from your templates</li>
<li>Clone to new book: Creates a duplicate of the current page/document, with which you can work</li>
</ul>
</p>
