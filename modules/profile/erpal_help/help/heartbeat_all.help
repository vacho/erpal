<h1>The heartbeat</h1>
<h2>ERPAL's central activity stream</h2>
<p>
This is ERPAL’s activity stream. The global heartbeat shows the recent activities for all users. The "Own heartbeat" tab displays only your recent activities. 
You can filter the heartbeat for a specific user, for a date or for the type of content.
If you’re working in a project, a project-related activity stream will appear on the project page. This shows the latest activities of your project's team.
